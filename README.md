# aprs-tnc-web-bridge

Documentation to come. See INSTALL to get going and http://127.0.0.1:5001/static/readme.html for more details. 

Essentially a KISS TNC (Serial/TCP) & APRS-IS direct -> Web interface (websockets/JSON API) with MQTT support for APRS analogue and digital telemetry channels as well as the usual mapping and messaging features. It can also act as a transparent bridge between a TNC and TCP, for example to allow a serial TNC to be accessible over a network.
